# PacMen Factory Exercise

## Description

In this Pacmen Factory Exercise, there are two buttons - "Add PacMen" and "Start Game". 
When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman appears at a random position on the screen and the "Start Game" button is clicked, the new pacmen created will start moving at random velocity on the screen. When a pacman hits the edge of the screen, it changes its direction.

## How to Run
Fork the repository, clone it to your machine, and drag the index.html file into your browser window. 

## Future Improvements
Include different color pacmen randomly.
